# Barometric Pressure and Temperature Sensor using BMP180

### Project Overview

The project aims to measure temperature and pressure using the BMP180 sensor and Arduino UNO. It initializes the BMP180 sensor and continuously reads temperature and pressure data.

### Components Needed

1. **Arduino UNO Board**
2. **BMP180 Pressure Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

**Pin Connection:**
- BMP180 VCC pin to Arduino 5V
- BMP180 GND pin to Arduino GND
- BMP180 SCL pin to Arduino A5 (SCL)
- BMP180 SDA pin to Arduino A4 (SDA)

### Instructions

1. **Connect the Sensor:**
   - Wire the BMP180 sensor to the Arduino UNO according to the circuit diagram.
   
2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Verify and upload the code to your Arduino board.
   
3. **Monitor the Serial Output:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view temperature and pressure data.
   - Ensure that the BMP180 sensor is initialized successfully and data is being read.

### Project Operation

- **Initialization:**
  - The Arduino initializes serial communication and checks if the BMP180 sensor initialization is successful.
  
- **Data Reading:**
  - The Arduino starts temperature measurement, waits for it to complete, and then reads temperature data.
  - It then starts pressure measurement, waits for it to complete, and reads pressure data.
  
- **Serial Output:**
  - Temperature and pressure data are printed to the Serial Monitor.

### Applications

- **Weather Monitoring:** Use the BMP180 sensor to monitor temperature and pressure for weather forecasting.
- **Altitude Measurement:** Calculate altitude based on atmospheric pressure.
- **Environmental Sensing:** Monitor environmental conditions in various applications.
